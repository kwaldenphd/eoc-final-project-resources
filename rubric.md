# Required Components

## Data
- Data source file
- URL to data source
- Reproducible code for API return (include API key, program will not be shared publicly)
- Other (based on conversation with instructor)

## Well-documented, working Python code for data wrangling/reshaping (as applicable)
- Renaming columns
- Selecting/sorting/filtering data
- Reshaping data (pivot, melt, stack, unstack, merge, join, etc)
- Other (based on conversation with instructor)

## Well-documented, working Python code for data analysis/visualiation
- Summary statistics
- More advanced statistical analysis
- Exploratory data visualization
- More advanced data visualization
- Other (based on conversation with instructor)

## Reflection
- At least 300 words
- Can be a separate document or a narrative embedded throughout the notebook/project

# Don't Forget
- Data frames need clear, meaningful field names
- Data visualizations need...
  * Title
  * Axis labels (as appropriate)
  * Scale (tick labels, tick marks, etc, as appropriate)
  * Legend (as appropriate)
- Working code is not sufficient! Code needs to be well-documented- that includes comments that explain steps you are taking, intended outcomes, what each line/block of code does, etc. 
- Reflection. Do not forget the reflection! 
  * Can be a separate document or a narrative embedded throughout the notebook/project.
