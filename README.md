Web Scraping: https://github.com/kwaldenphd/web-scraping-python

In terms of next steps, where I'd go next is figure out what it might look like to get the API return (JSON data) into a Pandas DataFrame.

A couple ways to do that:
- https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_json.html
- https://www.adamsmith.haus/python/answers/how-to-convert-a-json-string-to-a-pandas-dataframe-in-python

But if the JSON is highly nested or hierarchical, mapping it onto a two dimensional table structure will lose some important structural dimensions of the data.

A couple places to start with nested JSON data (the short version is usually some flavor of Pandas' json_normalize function):
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/converting-nested-json-structures-to-pandas-dataframes/

135. With the exception of some of the `Seaborn` plot types explored at the end of the lab, most of the plots focus on methods for plotting summary statistics.

136. Python can support a wide variety of statistical analysis methods and modelling techniques.

137. `statsmodels` is a Python module that supports a variety of regression and linear models, time series analysis, survival and duration analysis, and multivariate statistics.
- [Statsmodels documentation](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/user-guide.html)

138. `scikit-learn` is a machine learning Python library that supports a variety of classification algorithms (nearest neighbors, random forest, etc), regression models (nearest neighbors, random forest, etc), and clustering algorithms (k-Means, spectral, mean-shift, etc). 

139. `scikit-learn` incorporates/is built on `matplotlib` and has robust support for plotting and visualization.
