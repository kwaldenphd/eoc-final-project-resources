135. With the exception of some of the `Seaborn` plot types explored at the end of the lab, most of the plots focus on methods for plotting summary statistics.

136. Python can support a wide variety of statistical analysis methods and modelling techniques.

137. `statsmodels` is a Python module that supports a variety of regression and linear models, time series analysis, survival and duration analysis, and multivariate statistics.

138. `scikit-learn` is a machine learning Python library that supports a variety of classification algorithms (nearest neighbors, random forest, etc), regression models (nearest neighbors, random forest, etc), and clustering algorithms (k-Means, spectral, mean-shift, etc). 

139. `scikit-learn` incorporates/is built on `matplotlib` and has robust support for plotting and visualization.
