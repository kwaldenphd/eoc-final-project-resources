# Overview

*Content in this section is adapted from "[CSE Guide to the Honor Code](https://cse.nd.edu/undergraduate/cse-guide-to-the-honor-code)," last revised 2017/08/21.*

A quick internet search for “Python mad lib generator”...will yield the Python code necessary to build a mad lib generator. In fact many of the “possible options” listed above have sample code readily accessible on the internet.

I can understand the appeal of finding an online solution, making a few modifications, and submitting that as your final project. Many of you are carrying full course loads in a semester filled with extreme challenges and disruptions, individually, locally, nationally, and globally. We are all continuing to adapt and seek out coping mechanisms.

But, that said...

Students in all CSE courses are expected to abide by the Academic Code of Honor Pledge: “As a member of the Notre Dame community, I will not participate in or tolerate academic dishonesty.” An explanation of this pledge, and the consequences of breaking it, can be found in [The Undergraduate Student Academic Code of Honor Handbook](https://honorcode.nd.edu/) (hereafter cited as HC). 

Since there are various ways of using sources for assigned work, in CSE, we distinguish them in two ways:
- What kind of source: Is it a general resource that you are drawing on to do the assigned work, or is it a solution to the assigned work?
- How is the source used: Do you consult the source, or do you copy from it more or less verbatim?

For example, if your final project requires writing a Python function that implements quicksort:
<table><tr><td></td>
    <th>Resources</th>
    <th>Solutions</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><th>Consulting</th>
        <td> <p>You Google "quicksort" and read the Wikipedia article on quicksort</p>
                <p>You discuss quicksort with other students</p>
                <p>You forget how to swap two variables, so you look on Stack Overflow to remind yourself</p>
                <p>You forget how to swap two variables, and your friend reminds you</p></td>
        <td> <p>You Google "quicksort" and find an implementation of quicksort</p>
                <p>You look at another student's implementation of quicksort</p>
                <p>You and another student write an implementation of quicksort on the whiteboard, erase it, and you write your own implementation</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr><th>Copying</th>
        <td> <p>You forget how to swap two variables, so you look on Stack Overflow and reuse code you find there</p>
                <p>You ask your friend how to swap two variables, and you type what they say</p>
                <p>You find an implementation of quicksort and copy and paste it into your source file</p>
        </td>
        <td><p>You look at another student's implementation of quicksort and retype it in your source file</p>
            <p>You and another student write a implementation of quicksort on the whiteboard and then you retype it into your source file</p>
        </td>
    </tr>
    </table>

# Final Project Guidelines

Below are some additional guidelines as we approach the final project.  

<table><tr><td></td>
    <th>Resources</th>
    <th>Solutions</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><th>Consulting</th>
        <td bgcolor="yellow">cite</td>
        <td bgcolor="yellow">cite</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><th>Copying</th>
        <td bgcolor="yellow">cite</td>
        <td bgcolor="red">not allowed</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
Under such a policy, you are free to discuss problems with others and search for information online, provided you cite sources referenced. If you quote from a source or reuse a piece of code, you should cite the source (HC IV.B.2). But you shouldn't use another student's solutions, and if you happen to find a solution in a book or on a web page, you should not use the solution provided on that specific webpage/resource when continuing to work on the final project.

If you are unclear about whether certain forms of consultation or common work are acceptable or what the standards for citation are, consult with your instructor (HC IV.C.3).
