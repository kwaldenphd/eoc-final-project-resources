<p><i><span>Content in this section is adapted from &ldquo;</span></i><a href="https://cse.nd.edu/undergraduate/cse-guide-to-the-honor-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span>CSE Guide to the Honor Code</span></i></a><i><span>,&rdquo; last revised 2017/08/21.</span></i></p>
<p><span>A quick internet search for &ldquo;Python mad lib generator&rdquo;...will yield the Python code necessary to build a mad lib generator. In fact many of the &ldquo;possible options&rdquo; listed above have sample code readily accessible on the internet.</span></p>
<p><span>I can understand the appeal of finding an online solution, making a few modifications, and submitting that as your final project. Many of you are carrying full course loads in a semester filled with extreme challenges and disruptions, individually, locally, nationally, and globally. We are all continuing to adapt and seek out coping mechanisms.</span></p>
<p><span>But, that said...</span></p>
<p><span>Students in all CSE courses are expected to abide by the Academic Code of Honor Pledge: &ldquo;As a member of the Notre Dame community, I will not participate in or tolerate academic dishonesty.&rdquo; An explanation of this pledge, and the consequences of breaking it, can be found in </span><a href="https://honorcode.nd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>The Undergraduate Student Academic Code of Honor Handbook</span></a><span> (hereafter cited as HC). Below are some additional guidelines as we approach the final project.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since there are various ways of using sources for assigned work, in CSE, we distinguish them in two ways:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li aria-level="1"><span>What kind of source: Is it a general resource that you are drawing on to do the assigned work, or is it a solution to the assigned work?</span></li>
    <li aria-level="1"><span>How is the source used: Do you consult the source, or do you copy from it more or less verbatim?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>For example, if your final project requires writing a Python function that implements quicksort:</span></p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 98.5742%;" border="1">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td style="width: 12.4308%;"></td>
            <td style="width: 37.7811%; text-align: center;"><strong>Resources</strong></td>
            <td style="width: 49.7223%; text-align: center;"><strong>Solutions</strong></td>

                <p>You discuss quicksort with other students</p>
                <p>You forget how to swap two variables, so you look on Stack Overflow to remind yourself</p>

                <p>You and another student write an implementation of quicksort on the whiteboard, erase it, and you write your own implementation</p>

            <td style="width: 49.7223%;">

<p><span>Under such a policy, you are free to discuss problems with others and search for information online, provided you cite sources referenced. If you quote from a source or reuse a piece of code, you should cite the source (HC IV.B.2). But you shouldn't use another student's solutions, and if you happen to find a solution in a book or on a web page, you should not use the solution provided on that specific webpage/resource when continuing to work on the final project..</span></p>
<p><span>If you are unclear about whether certain forms of consultation or common work are acceptable or what the standards for citation are, consult with your instructor (HC IV.C.3).</span></p>
<h4><strong>Resources vs. solutions</strong></h4>
<p><span>Every assignment comes with some requirement that you do some work, and that this work be your own. A source that partially or totally fulfills that requirement is a solution; anything else is a resource.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, consider again an assignment to implement quicksort. There's no expectation for you to reinvent quicksort; therefore, talking to people about quicksort and reading about quicksort is making use of a resource. But an actual implementation of quicksort would fulfill the requirements of the assignment, so someone else's implementation of quicksort (whether another students' or from a book or online) is a solution.</span></p>
<p><span>Now imagine that your assignment is to come up with an idea for a mobile app and implement it. There's probably no expectation for you to write every single part from scratch. So if your app contained someone else's code for quicksort (with proper citation), that would probably be considered a resource.</span></p>
<p><span>So, whether a source is considered a resource or a solution depends on the assignment; when in doubt, ask the instructor.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Consulting vs. copying</strong></h4>
<p><span>The Honor Code follows standard practice from academia and intellectual-property law: if you use either the words or the ideas of someone else, you must properly cite them. It's part of your education to learn to follow this practice (and part of our job as faculty to teach you).</span></p>
<p><span>However, it is not always easy to know, either in school or in real life, where to draw the line. So we offer two more concrete criteria, one broader and one narrower, that are easier to apply.</span></p>
<h5><strong>Consulting</strong></h5>
<p><span>By "consulting" a source, we mean receiving any kind of information from the source, whether it's a book or web page or another person.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are required to cite any sources that you consulted, the citation should identify the source and indicate what part of the assignment you were working on when you consulted the source. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
    <li aria-level="1"><span>I worked on the whole assignment with John Doe</span></li>
    <li aria-level="1"><span>I referred to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort for Problem 3</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Copying</strong></h5>
<p><span>By "copying," we mean electronic copying of data or reading/listening to a source while writing down what you see/hear. Copying while paraphrasing (e.g., changing variable names or replacing words with synonyms) is still copying.</span></p>
<p><span>Exception: In CSE courses, there are cases of boilerplate code or language that can always be copied without restriction. For example, no one would consider it plagiarism to copy int main (int argc, char *argv[]). When in doubt, ask an instructor or TA.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are required to cite any sources that you copied from, you must clearly indicate exactly what part of the assignment is copied from that source. In writing, this means following standard conventions (using quotation marks or indenting block quotes); in code, use comments to mark off exactly which lines, functions, or files are reused.&nbsp;</span></p>
