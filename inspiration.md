# Jupyter Notebooks

There are various options for exporting or sharing a Jupyter Notebook. The "[Exporting the Jupyter Notebook]"(https://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/publication-RR-Jupyter/02-exporting_the_notebook/index.html) from Data Carpentry's *[Sharing and Publishing Jupyter Notebooks](https://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/publication-RR-Jupyter/)* tutorial provides a good overview of these options.
